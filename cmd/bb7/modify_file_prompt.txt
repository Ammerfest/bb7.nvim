## File Tools

You have two file tools. `modify_file` is your primary tool:

- `modify_file` — Apply targeted changes to an existing file. Use this for all edits to existing files, regardless of how many changes are needed.
- `write_file` — Write a complete file. Use this only for creating new files. Every `write_file` call must contain the complete file content.

For existing files, always use `modify_file` — even for large edits spanning many regions. Only use `write_file` on an existing file if you are replacing it with entirely different content (different structure, different purpose). When in doubt, use `modify_file`.

Rules for all file tool calls:
- One file per call. Each call targets exactly one file path.
- One call per file. Do not call any file tool more than once for the same path in a single response.
- Do not mix tools for the same file. Never use both `modify_file` and `write_file` for the same path in one response.

## modify_file Reference

### Definitions

`modify_file(path, changes)` applies a list of changes to an existing file. Each change locates a contiguous region of lines in the file and replaces it entirely.

A **change** has three fields:
- `start` (required): Array of 1-4 strings. Must match consecutive lines in the file exactly once.
- `end` (optional): Array of 1-4 strings. Must match consecutive lines that occur after the `start` match exactly once.
- `content` (required): Array of strings. The exact, complete replacement for the matched region.

The **region** of a change is:
- If `end` is omitted: the lines matched by `start`.
- If `end` is present: all lines from the first line of the `start` match through the last line of the `end` match, inclusive.

**Replacement**: The entire region is removed and `content` is inserted in its place. To preserve a line from the region, repeat it in `content`. To modify a line, include a modified copy in `content`. To delete the entire region, pass an empty `content` array.

**Matching**: Anchors are compared to file lines by exact string equality. IMPORTANT: Anchors must match exactly once! If anchors can match at more than one place in the file, the tool call fails. Use multi-line anchors (2-4 lines) to disambiguate.

**Ordering**: Changes must not overlap. They may be listed in any order.

### Examples

All examples operate on this file:
```
apple
banana
cherry
date
elderberry
fig
banana
grape
honeydew
kiwi
lemon
```

**Replace one line** (change "cherry" to "cranberry"):
```json
{"start": ["cherry"], "content": ["cranberry"]}
```
Region is line 3 ("cherry"). It is removed and replaced by "cranberry".

**Insert after a line** (add "apricot" after "apple"):
```json
{"start": ["apple"], "content": ["apple", "apricot"]}
```
Region is line 1 ("apple"). It is removed and replaced by "apple", "apricot". The anchor is preserved because it appears in `content`.

**Replace a range** (replace "date" through "fig" with one line):
```json
{"start": ["date"], "end": ["fig"], "content": ["dragonfruit"]}
```
Region is lines 4-6 ("date", "elderberry", "fig"). All three are removed and replaced by "dragonfruit".

**Delete lines** (remove "honeydew" and "kiwi"):
```json
{"start": ["honeydew"], "end": ["kiwi"], "content": []}
```
Region is lines 9-10. Both are removed. Nothing is inserted.

**Multi-line anchor** ("banana" appears on lines 2 and 7; target the second):
```json
{"start": ["fig", "banana"], "content": ["fig", "blueberry"]}
```
"fig", "banana" matches only at lines 6-7. Region is removed and replaced by "fig", "blueberry". The "fig" anchor is preserved in `content`.

**Error — anchor not found**:
```json
{"start": ["orange"], "content": ["tangerine"]}
```
"orange" does not exist in the file. The change fails.

**Error — anchor not unique**:
```json
{"start": ["banana"], "content": ["plantain"]}
```
"banana" matches lines 2 and 7. The change fails. Fix: use a multi-line anchor like `["apple", "banana"]` or `["fig", "banana"]`.

**Error — overlapping regions**:
```json
[
  {"start": ["cherry"], "end": ["elderberry"], "content": ["new"]},
  {"start": ["date"], "content": ["new"]}
]
```
"date" (line 4) is inside the first region (lines 3-5). The regions overlap. The entire call fails.

### Anchor Selection

- Prefer unique lines: function signatures, class declarations, import statements, unique comments.
- If a single line is ambiguous, use 2-3 lines as the anchor.
- Do not use common lines like `}` or blank lines as single-line anchors.

### Guidelines

- Omit `end` for small, localized edits where `start` lines cover the entire region.
- Use `start` + `end` for larger replacements to avoid reproducing unchanged code.
- If two changes are close together (within ~5 lines), merge them into one change.
- Changes within one file must not overlap.
