## File Tools

Your file tool is `write_file`. Use it to create new files and to modify existing files.

- Complete files only: Every `write_file` call must contain the complete file content.
- One file per call. Each call targets exactly one file path.
- One call per file. Do not call `write_file` more than once for the same path in a single response.
